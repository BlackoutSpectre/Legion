 * Created by Seth Chick on 1/24/2016.
 *
 * The class is used to detect objects by using distance sensors (like the ultrasonic sensor)
 * to detect objects that are in the way of the robot. Update this class as quickly as possible.
 * This not a file config, set this up when constructing the Navigation class.
